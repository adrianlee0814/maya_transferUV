# maya_transferUV
This script allows you to select objects and transfer UV attributes by TOPOLOGY, preferably to the same mesh. Copy into the script editor and add to shelf for easy access.

Currently it works on a one to one selection, I don't see it used very often so I did not turn it into an UI

Instructions: 
Just copy the whole code of transferUV.py into script editor and add it to the shelf
